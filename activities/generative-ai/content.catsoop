# Generative AI Competition
In all of our classes, we've at least seen a little bit about generative AI and how it can be used to create wild images! If you want more information about generative AI, the presentation I did in class can did in class can be found below.  

This week in our repaso, I want to have a competition for who can make the best image with the generative AI. "Best" can be: 
- the funniest
- the most interesting
- the most colorful

Whatever you want!


At the end of the week, we will vote!
