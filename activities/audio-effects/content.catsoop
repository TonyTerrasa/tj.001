<h2>Assignment</h2>


<p>
Today, we are going to explore different types of effects that we can add to our audios on <a href="https://twistedwave.com/online">Twisted Wave</a>.


We will then <strong>put our audio in the powerpoint</strong>
</p>



<h2>Copy and Paste</h2>


<p>
The first exercise is not an effect, but rather an important skill for the rest of the exercises which is select, copy, and paste. Follow the steps bellow: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Record yourself saying ‚Äúthis is my voice‚Äù
<li>Trim the silence and normalize the track 
    <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Highlight</em></strong> the silence
    <li>Press Backspace
    <li>Go to Effects -> Normalize
    </li> 
    </ol>
<li>Copy the part where you speak 
    <ol>
    <li>Highlight the part of the audio where you speak. 
    <li>Press 'Ctrl+C' 
    <li>Place your clicker at the end of the audio. 
    <li>Press 'Ctrl+V'. You should have the same audio 2 times. 
    </li>
    </ol>
<li>Use these steps (highlight, 'Ctrl+C', 'Ctrl+V') to make your audio say: 
</li>
</ol>
<p class="lyrics">
this is my voice<br> 
this is my voice<br> 
this is my <br> 
this is my<br> 
this is my voice<br> 
</p>
<p>
Upload the result! This is an example (but it should be in your voice)
</p>

<h2>Reverse</h2>


<p>
Now we will <em>reverse</em> our audio. We make the audio play backwards.
</p>
<ol>

<li>Record yourself saying ‚Äúthis is my voice the right way forward‚Äù
<li>Trim the silence and normalize the track 
    <ol>
    <li><strong><em>Highlight</em></strong> the silence
    <li>Press Backspace
    <li>Go to Effects -> Normalize
    </li> 
    </ol>
<li>Copy the part where you speak. You should have the same audio 2 times.
    <ol>
    <li>Highlight the part of the audio where you speak. 
    <li>Press 'Ctrl+C' 
    <li>Place your clicker at the end of the audio. 
    <li>Press 'Ctrl+V' 
    </ol>

<li>Now, highlight the <strong>copy</strong> of your voice. 
<li>Click <em>Effects -> Reverse</em>
<li>Play the audio to make sure it‚Äôs correct. 
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Now, we want to show you that the reverse effect is <strong>reversible</strong>. This means, if we apply the effect again,  we will get the original audio. Now:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Highlight your <strong>reversed</strong> audio. And make a copy 
<ol>
 
<li>Press 'Ctrl+C' 
 
<li>Place your clicker at the end of the audio. 
 
<li>Press 'Ctrl+V' 
</li> 
</ol>

<li>Highlight the 3rd copy of your original audio

<li>Click <em>Effects -> Reverse</em>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Upload the result! This is an example (but it should be in your voice)

<h2>Delay (Echo)</h2>


<p>
Now we will add <em>delay</em> to our audio. This adds an <em>echo</em> to the sound. Think as if you were in a really big canyon. 
</p>
<ol>

<li>Record yourself saying ‚Äúthis clean or dry, this has delay‚Äù

<li>Trim the silence and normalize the track 
<ol>
 
<li><strong><em>Highlight</em></strong> the silence
 
<li>Press Backspace
 
<li>Go to <em>Effects -> Normalize</em>
</li> 
</ol>

<li>How, highlight the part of the audio where you say ‚Äúthis has delay‚Äù

<li>Click <em>Effects -> VST Effects -> mdaDelay.so</em>

<li>Click <em>Apply</em>

<li>Play the audio to make sure it‚Äôs correct. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Upload the result! This is an example (but it should be in your voice)
</p>

</p>
<h2>Reverb</h2>


<p>
Now we will add <em>reverb</em> to our audio. This makes it sound like your audio is happening in a room. People like this because it sounds more natural.
</p>
<ol>

<li>Record yourself saying ‚Äúthis clean, this is with reverb‚Äù

<li>Trim the silence and normalize the track 
<ol>
 
<li><strong><em>Highlight</em></strong> the silence
 
<li>Press Backspace
 
<li>Go to <em>Effects -> Normalize</em>
</li> 
</ol>

<li>How, highlight the part of the audio where you say ‚Äúthis is with reverb‚Äù

<li>Click <em>Effects -> VST Effects -> freeverb.so</em>

<li>Adjust the ‚Äúwet‚Äù and ‚Äúdry‚Äù sliders to get something like what I have 

<li>Click <em>Apply</em>

<li>Play the audio to make sure it‚Äôs correct. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Upload the result! This is an example (but it should be in your voice)

<h2>Equalization (EQ)</h2>


<h2>Putting Audio in Google Slides</h2>
Follow this YouTube video which explains how to insert audio into a Google Slide. In you current Google Slide presentation, add a slide which explains each effect we used today and contains your example.
