<h2>Teejaylandia</h2>


<p>
Once upon a time there was a beautiful city called Teejaylandia. It had some of the most advanced technology in the world, including ships that could <strong>float</strong> on air. The people loved to hike and walk around in nature. It was right next to several majestic mountains and a beautiful lake.

<p>
However, things did not stay perfect forever. The citizens didnâ€™t know that one of the mountains was actually a volcano! One day, with no warning, this volcano <strong>erupted</strong>. The Earth was <strong>shaking</strong> and there was lava <strong>running</strong> down the side, straight towards Teejaylandia!

<p>
After just one hour, Teejaylandia was in serious trouble. The lava had started to reach the city. Bridges were <strong>collapsing </strong>and <strong>knocked-over</strong> people had to run away.

<p>
Luckily for the citizens of Teejaylandia, they exist in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">MCU</a> and the Avengers quickly received a message that they were in trouble. The Avengers arrived and tried to help the best they could. Some were <strong>dragging</strong> people to safety on <strong>cracked</strong> roads while others went to stop the lava.

<p>
The Hulk went to deal with the volcano. For everyone else, it was <strong>too heavy to lift</strong>. But Hulk is the strongest Avenger. He picked up the entire volcano and decided to move it. He had to be careful because it was <strong>so full that</strong> if he <strong>shook</strong> it, a lot of lava would fall out onto him.

<p>
Hulk found a safe place, and threw the volcano. It then <strong>smashed</strong> into a million pieces far away from Teejaylandia.

The people of Teejaylandia were so happy that the Avengers saved them. They thought it was <strong>such a miracle that they</strong> had to thank them. So, they threw a big dinner party and everyone lived happily ever after.
