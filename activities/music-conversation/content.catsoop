<h2>Script</h2>


<p>
<em>It’s May 1st, 2022. Harry Styles’s song “As It Was” hit more streams on Spotify than Olivia Rodrigo’s “Drivers License.” Olivia, wanting to congratulate Harry, calls him to chat. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>(cell phone rings, Harry picks up)</em>
</p>
<p>
Harry: Hello?
</p>
<p>
Olivia: Hey Harry, it’s Olivia, how’s it going?
</p>
<p>
Harry: Oh hey Olivia! Everything’s good. I just finished eating lunch. I was looking at <strong>the charts</strong> and it seems like you have some competition..... 
</p>
<p>
Olivia: Wow, there. You’re not the only one with a <strong>massive hit</strong> on Spotify. But yes..... It’s true. I actually wanted to congratulate you. It’s great that your track is doing so well!
</p>
<p>
Harry: Thank you, I appreciate it. Though my <strong>debut album </strong>was nowhere near as successful as yours.
</p>
<p>
Olivia: Haha, as if your 2 billion streams weren’t impressive. But seriously, we had very different <strong>come-ups</strong>. You started in One Direction and had to transition to<strong> go solo</strong>. I came up on TikTok and I’ve always sort of been the <strong>lead singer</strong> in the music I write. 
</p>
<p>
Harry: I suppose you’re right. We both are doing very well. 
</p>
<p>
Olivia: It’s true. Besides, I really look up to you. I’m planning a <strong>world tour</strong> right now. I want to see new places, play at new <strong>venues</strong>, and have the same impact that you’ve had on the world. By the way, I’ve always wondered, what made you leave One Direction?
</p>
<p>
Harry: Honestly, it was a very difficult decision. I loved the guys, but just felt that in One Direction, I wasn’t able to express myself as much as I wanted. 
</p>
<p>
Olivia: When you <span style="text-decoration:underline;">went solo</span>, were you able to <strong>release tracks </strong>that were more individual to you?
</p>
<p>
Harry: I definitely think so. When I <strong>dropped</strong> my <span style="text-decoration:underline;">debut album</span>, Harry Styles, it was scary. I didn’t know if I had <strong>devoted fans</strong> of my own or if the fans would forget me without the rest of One Direction. I was really happy to see people listening to my solo music. Though sometimes I wonder if with that many streams people are really listening to my music or using it as <strong>background music</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
Olivia: What do you mean?
</p>
<p>
Harry:  Well, some of my music is really personal. If people use it as <span style="text-decoration:underline;">background music</span>, are they really listening to what I’m singing about?
</p>
<p>
Olivia: I see. Sometimes I think about that too. But, I like to think that when people see us <strong>give a live performance</strong>, they are paying attention. Lots of people come to see our live shows. Lots of people sing with us.
</p>
<p>
Harry: That’s true. All those people <strong>singing along</strong> with us definitely know the words to the songs... Well anyway, thanks for calling. Maybe one day, we can do a tour together. 
</p>
<p>
Olivia: I would love that. Let’s be in touch. Congratulations again, Harry. Have a good day!
</p>
<p>
Harry: Thanks, you too, Olivia. Bye
</p>
