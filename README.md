# Welcome

Hello, this is my first attempt at a CATSOOP course for learning English! The purpose of this site is to post materials and and questions for use in both private and for in-school lessons. 

My basic goals were to:
- [x] post various types of questions with instant feedback including multiple choice, fill in the blank
- [x] post readings for students to read
- [x] publish the site so it can be available publicly for my students

All of these having now be achieved, I'm moving towards:
- [ ] create and store student accounts
- [ ] allow students to submit extended response questions to me so that I can read them on my own


# Standing CATSOOP Questions

- how to direct the domain directly to the website, not to the CATSOOP home
- how go set up student accounts?
- how to allow students to turn in files (like if I want to be able to listen to their audio)
- can I have people record audio from their webbrowser and turn it in?
 
# Progress Log

## October 8 2022

First sucessful deployment where you could access the site from a public URL. 

For right now, I don't like that if you go to the domain, you get to the page home catsoop page. Instead, I want the URL to go directly to the page.

## September 16 2022

Today, I learned that in order to see real changes as I am making them, I need not restart catsoop, rather just reload the page

Today, I also explored the main `preload.py` file which containts information on users, colors, and the navigation of the coarse site.
