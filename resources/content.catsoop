## Grammar
- [Quick List of the Tenses with Examples](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/verb-tenses.htm)


## Translation
- [Reverso Context](https://context.reverso.net/translation/): Gives translations via passages that have been translated between the two languages. Really good for seeing the *context* that words are used in. I find this one to be particularly good for phrases with multiple or no direct translations
- [Linguee](https://www.linguee.com/): decent word translator
- [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator?utm_source=lingueecom&utm_medium=linguee&utm_content=header_translator): good for sentences or phrases, but should not be used for converting passages
