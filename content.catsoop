# Welcome

Hello, this is my first attempt at a CATSOOP course for learning English! My goal is to use this as a starting point for being able to take student feedback through this system for both private lessons and for in school materials. 

My goals basic goals are to be able to:
- [ ] post various types of questions with instant feedback including multiple choice, fill in the blank
- [ ] post readings for students to read
- [ ] publish the site so it can be available publicly for my students

My stretch goals would be to: 
- [ ] create and store student accounts
- [ ] allow students to submit extended response questions to me xso that I can read them on my own


# Progress Log

## Things I am considering posting on the forum

- is there support for markdown checklists, could potentially be based on [these](https://github.blog/2014-04-28-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents/)
- how go set up student accounts?
- can I have people record audio from their webbrowser and turn it in?
- how to allow students to turn in files (like if I want to be able to listen to their audio)

## September 16

Today, I learned that in order to see real changes as I am making them, I need not restart catsoop, rather just reload the page

Today, I also explored the main `preload.py` file which containts information on users, colors, and the navigation of the coarse site.
