<h1>Introduction</h1>


<p>
<strong>Transcription</strong> is the process of listening to a piece of media (e.g. a song, TV show, movie, YouTube video, TikTok) and writing down the EXACT words that are said. Doing transcriptions is great for your ears because it makes sure you hear precisely what people hear, not just approximations. It forces you to trust and have confidence in your ear and your comprehension. For me, transcriptions have been the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">number 1</span> way that I’ve become more comfortable understanding Spanish. 
</p>
<p>
Below, I will explain my process for doing transcriptions. I will focus on <strong>music</strong>, but this can be extendable to any number of media types. 
</p>
<h1>Process</h1>


<p>
First of all, try to transcribe 1-4 lines at a time, NOT MORE. For me, it is too much to 
</p>
<ol>

<li>I find the section that I want to transcribe and find the timestamps (e.g. from 1:02-1:17 in the video)

<li>I listen closely 2-3 times. I do not take notes. I think “what do I understand?” “Can I memorize some of it?” “What parts do I not understand?”

<li>I write down everything I remember

<li>I listen again and check what I’ve written

<li>Listen and see if I can phonetically (by how it sounds, not knowing what the words mean) write the words I don’t understand

<li>Only when I am 100% SURE that I cannot write any more, I check my answer online
</li>
</ol>

I recommend using <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a> for looking up lyrics. It is an excellent source of lyrics and explanations.

<h1>Extensions</h1>


<p>
This technique can be extended to any piece of media you can find the words to including: 
</p>
<ul>

<li>YouTube

<li>Netflix/Disney/Streaming
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On youtube, click the button that says “CC” at the bottom of the video to add the subtitles. 
</p>
<p>
On most streaming services (e.g. Netflix, Disney, there is a button on the bottom bar to show the subtitles. This is how you can check you answers!
